## Hirudinea
Hirudinea is the scientific name of a leech, which is the organism that this code tries to emulate. The program simulates the dynamics of a tensegrity robot that is modeled to reflect the movement patterns of a leech.

# Structure
The main simulation file is dynamix, which calculates the forces of the different members and strings.
The notebook Dynamic_Solver is used to feed the structure and information into this file as well as run the ODE solver
